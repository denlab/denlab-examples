Is it possible to use shell completion with make as follows: ?

- Given the following =Makefile=: 
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  a: @: ; 
  b: @: ;
  c: @: ;
#+END_SRC

- In a bash shell: 
  - =make <TAB><TAB>=
  - will propose the following completions: =a b c=
  
- Now, is it possible to have a dynamic completion depending on the already passed targets on the command line.
  - In order to have: =make a <TAB><TAB>=
  - Different from  : =make b <TAB><TAB>=
